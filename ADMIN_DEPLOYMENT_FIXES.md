# ðŸ”§ ADMIN DEPLOYMENT FIXES

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Service Worker Registration Error
**Problem**: Admin app was trying to register service worker at `/undefined/sw.js`
**Root Cause**: Using `process.env.PUBLIC_URL` which is undefined in admin app
**Solution**: Admin app doesn't need service worker - removed any service worker registration

### 2. Variable Initialization Error
**Problem**: `ReferenceError: Cannot access 'G' before initialization`
**Root Cause**: React 19 compatibility issues and improper component initialization
**Solution**: 
- Fixed main.jsx to properly initialize React root
- Added proper error handling for root element
- Wrapped app in React.StrictMode properly

### 3. Build Configuration Issues
**Problem**: Build artifacts had incorrect references and missing optimization
**Solution**: Updated vite.config.js with:
- Proper base path configuration
- Disabled sourcemaps for production
- Fixed chunk splitting issues
- Added proper build output configuration

## Files Modified

### 1. `admin/vite.config.js`
- Added proper base path and build configuration
- Disabled sourcemaps for production
- Fixed rollup options to prevent chunk issues

### 2. `admin/src/main.jsx`
- Fixed React root initialization
- Added proper error handling
- Wrapped in React.StrictMode correctly

### 3. `admin/netlify.toml`
- Added security headers
- Improved caching configuration
- Added proper environment variables

### 4. `admin/dist/index.html`
- Updated asset references to match built files
