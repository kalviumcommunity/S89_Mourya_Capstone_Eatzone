## Security Vulnerabilities Fixed

### âœ… 1. Account Takeover Prevention
**Issue**: Google OAuth automatically linked accounts by email without verification
**Fix**: Removed automatic account linking, returns error for existing emails
**Impact**: Prevents unauthorized account takeover attacks

### âœ… 2. Admin Registration Security
**Issue**: Admin registration endpoint was unprotected
**Fix**: Added SUPER_ADMIN_KEY requirement and single admin limit
**Impact**: Prevents unauthorized admin account creation

### âœ… 3. Cart Data Validation
**Issue**: No server-side validation of cart data
**Fix**: Comprehensive validation with business rules and database verification
**Impact**: Prevents cart manipulation and invalid data injection

### âœ… 4. Authorization Bypass Prevention
**Issue**: Restaurant management used hardcoded admin checks
**Fix**: Proper JWT-based authorization with ownership validation
**Impact**: Prevents unauthorized restaurant modifications

### âœ… 5. Legacy Data Handling
**Issue**: Legacy restaurants without adminId could be exploited
**Fix**: Secure legacy data claiming with audit logging
**Impact**: Proper ownership assignment for legacy data

## Security Features Implemented

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication with secure token validation
- Role-based access control for admin functions
- Super admin key requirement for admin registration
- Secure password hashing with bcrypt (14 salt rounds)

### Data Validation
- MongoDB ObjectId format validation
- Business rule enforcement (quantity limits, cart size)
- Database existence verification for cart items
- Input sanitization and type checking

### Audit & Logging
- Security event logging for admin actions
- Unauthorized access attempt logging
- Legacy data claiming audit trail
- Error logging without sensitive data exposure

### Rate Limiting & Protection
- Cart size limits (configurable via environment)
- Maximum items per product limits
- Single admin account restriction
- Strong password requirements

## Environment Variables Required

```bash
# Security Keys
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-here
SUPER_ADMIN_KEY=your-super-admin-key-for-registration

# Cart Security
MAX_CART_QUANTITY_PER_ITEM=50
MAX_TOTAL_CART_ITEMS=200
```

## Admin Setup Process

1. Set `SUPER_ADMIN_KEY` in environment variables
2. Use the key to register the first admin account
3. Remove or rotate the key after setup
4. All subsequent admin operations use JWT authentication

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers
- Never commit `.env` files
- Rotate secrets regularly
- Use strong, unique passwords
- Enable HTTPS in production
- Implement rate limiting
- Monitor security logs

### For Deployment
- Use environment-specific secrets
- Enable security headers
- Implement proper CORS policies
- Use secure session management
- Regular security audits
- Monitor for suspicious activity

## Security Monitoring

The application logs the following security events:
- Admin account creation
- Unauthorized access attempts
- Cart manipulation attempts
- Legacy data claiming
- Authentication failures

## Incident Response

If a security incident is detected:
1. Check security logs for details
2. Rotate affected credentials
3. Review and update access controls
4. Monitor for continued suspicious activity
5. Update security measures as needed
