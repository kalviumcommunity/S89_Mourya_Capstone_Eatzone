# üöÄ EatZone Deployment Fix Guide

## üéØ **ISSUE IDENTIFIED**
Your https://eatzone1.netlify.app/ is showing the **admin panel** instead of the **user application** because the root `netlify.toml` was configured to deploy the admin panel.

## ‚úÖ **SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**

### 1. **Fixed Root Configuration**
Updated `netlify.toml` to deploy the **client application** instead of admin:
```toml
[build]
  base = "client"          # Changed from "admin" to "client"
  command = "npm ci && npm run build"
  publish = "dist"
```

### 2. **Updated Admin Configuration**
Enhanced `admin/netlify.toml` with proper environment variables for separate admin deployment.

## üîß **DEPLOYMENT STEPS**

### **Step 1: Deploy Client App to eatzone1.netlify.app**

1. **Go to Netlify Dashboard**
   - Visit [Netlify Dashboard](https://app.netlify.com)
   - Find your `eatzone1.netlify.app` site

2. **Deploy Updated Client**
   - Go to **Deploys** tab
   - Click **"Deploy site"** ‚Üí **"Deploy manually"**
   - Drag and drop the `client/dist` folder
   - OR use the updated root `netlify.toml` by triggering a new build

3. **Verify Environment Variables**
   In Site settings ‚Üí Environment variables, ensure:
   ```
   VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://eatzone.onrender.com
   VITE_APP_ENV=production
   NODE_ENV=production
   ```

### **Step 2: Deploy Admin Panel to eatzone.netlify.app**

1. **Go to eatzone.netlify.app site**
   - In Netlify dashboard, find your `eatzone.netlify.app` site

2. **Deploy Admin Panel**
   - Go to **Deploys** tab
   - Drag and drop the `admin/dist` folder
   - OR connect the admin folder with the updated `admin/netlify.toml`

3. **Set Admin Environment Variables**
   ```
   VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://eatzone.onrender.com
   VITE_APP_ENV=production
   NODE_ENV=production
   ```

## üéâ **EXPECTED RESULT**

After deployment:
- **https://eatzone1.netlify.app/** ‚Üí **User Application** (Home, Cart, Orders, etc.)
- **https://eatzone.netlify.app/** ‚Üí **Admin Panel** (Dashboard, Add Items, etc.)

## üîç **VERIFICATION CHECKLIST**

### If Admin Panel Not Working:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify API URL in environment variables

4. Ensure backend server is running

## üìù **FILES MODIFIED**
- `netlify.toml` - Changed base from "admin" to "client"

The fix is ready! Deploy the updated configurations and your sites should work correctly.
