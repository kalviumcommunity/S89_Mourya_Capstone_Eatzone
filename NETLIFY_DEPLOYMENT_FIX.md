# ðŸš¨ Netlify Deployment Fix - Multiple Sites Issue

## ðŸŽ¯ **PROBLEM IDENTIFIED**
You have **two Netlify sites** trying to deploy from the same GitHub repository:
- `eatzone1.netlify.app` (should be CLIENT app)
- `eatzone.netlify.app` (should be ADMIN panel)

Both sites are using the same root `netlify.toml`, causing conflicts and deployment failures.

## âœ… **SOLUTION: Separate Deployment Strategy**

### **Step 1: Fix eatzone1.netlify.app (Client App)**

1. **Go to Netlify Dashboard**
   - Find your `eatzone1.netlify.app` site
   - Go to **Site settings** â†’ **Build & deploy**

2. **Update Build Settings**
   ```
   Base directory: client
   Build command: npm ci && npm run build
   Publish directory: client/dist
   ```

3. **Set Environment Variables**
   In Site settings â†’ Environment variables:
   ```
   NODE_VERSION=18
   VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://eatzone.onrender.com
   VITE_APP_ENV=production
   NODE_ENV=production
   ```

4. **Deploy Branch Settings**
   - Production branch: `mono` (or your main branch)
   - Deploy previews: Enabled

### **Step 2: Fix eatzone.netlify.app (Admin Panel)**

**Option A: Manual Deployment (Recommended)**
1. Build admin locally:
   ```bash
   cd admin
   npm ci && npm run build
   ```
2. Go to `eatzone.netlify.app` â†’ Deploys
3. Drag and drop the `admin/dist` folder

**Option B: Separate Repository**
1. Create a new repository for admin panel
2. Copy admin folder contents
3. Connect new repo to `eatzone.netlify.app`

### **Step 3: Update GitHub Repository**

1. **Disable Auto-Deploy for Admin Site**
   - Go to `eatzone.netlify.app` settings
   - Disconnect from GitHub (use manual deploys)

2. **Keep Auto-Deploy for Client Site**
   - `eatzone1.netlify.app` stays connected to GitHub
   - Uses the root `netlify.toml` for client deployment

## ðŸ”§ **Quick Fix Commands**

### **Build and Deploy Client:**
```bash
# Run this in your project root
cd client
npm ci
npm run build
# Then manually deploy client/dist to eatzone1.netlify.app
```

### **Build and Deploy Admin:**
```bash
# Run this in your project root
cd admin
npm ci
npm run build
# Then manually deploy admin/dist to eatzone.netlify.app
```

## ðŸŽ‰ **Expected Result**

After implementing this fix:
- âœ… `https://eatzone1.netlify.app/` â†’ Client application (restaurants, food, cart)
- âœ… `https://eatzone.netlify.app/` â†’ Admin panel (dashboard, manage items)
- âœ… No more deployment conflicts
- âœ… Both sites deploy successfully

## ðŸš€ **Immediate Action Plan**

1. **Disconnect eatzone.netlify.app from GitHub**
2. **Use manual deployment for admin panel**
3. **Keep eatzone1.netlify.app connected to GitHub**
4. **Test both deployments**

This approach eliminates the conflicts and ensures both sites work correctly!
