# EatZone Deployment Fix Guide

## Issues Fixed ‚úÖ

### 1. **Missing Routes in App.jsx**
- **Problem**: The main App.jsx was missing critical routes like `/cart`, `/profile`, `/myorders`, etc.
- **Solution**: Added all necessary routes with proper authentication protection:
  - `/cart` - Shopping cart page
  - `/profile` - User profile page (protected)
  - `/myorders` - User orders page (protected)
  - `/order` - Place order page
  - `/restaurant/:id` - Restaurant details page
  - `/verify` - Payment verification page
  - `/auth/*` - Authentication success page

### 2. **StoreContext Missing Authentication Functions**
- **Problem**: StoreContext was missing essential authentication and user management functions
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive authentication system:
  - `fetchUserProfile()` - Fetch user data from server
  - `logout()` - Clear user data and tokens
  - `setTokenAndUser()` - Proper token and user data management
  - `loadCart()` and `saveCartToServer()` - Cart persistence
  - Proper localStorage management for tokens and user data

### 3. **Environment Configuration Issues**
- **Problem**: Incorrect environment variable setup causing deployment failures
- **Solution**: Fixed environment configuration:
  - Removed `NODE_ENV=production` from .env (not supported in Vite)
  - Ensured proper API URL configuration
  - Added Google OAuth configuration placeholders

### 4. **Server Connectivity Verified**
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Server is running and healthy at `https://eatzone.onrender.com`
- **Health Check**: Returns 200 OK with proper service status
- **CORS**: Properly configured for Netlify deployment

## Deployment Steps üöÄ

### For Client (Netlify)

1. **Build the application:**
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy to Netlify:**
   - Option A: Drag and drop the `dist` folder to Netlify dashboard
   - Option B: Use Netlify CLI:
     ```bash
     netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
     ```

3. **Environment Variables on Netlify:**
   Set these in Netlify dashboard ‚Üí Site settings ‚Üí Environment variables:
   ```
   VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://eatzone.onrender.com
   VITE_APP_ENV=production
   NODE_VERSION=18
   ```

### For Server (Render)

1. **Server is already deployed and running**
2. **Environment Variables on Render:**
   ```
   MONGODB_URI=your-mongodb-connection-string
   PORT=4000
   NODE_ENV=production
   FRONTEND_URL=https://eatzone1.netlify.app
   ADMIN_URL=your-admin-netlify-url
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your-stripe-secret-key
   ```

## Testing Checklist ‚úÖ

### Local Testing
- [x] Client builds successfully without errors
- [x] Server is accessible and returns health status
- [x] All routes are properly configured
- [x] Authentication context is working
- [x] Environment variables are properly set

### Production Testing
After deployment, test these URLs:

1. **Client Application:**
   - https://eatzone1.netlify.app (should load home page)
   - https://eatzone1.netlify.app/cart (should load cart page)
   - https://eatzone1.netlify.app/profile (should redirect to home if not logged in)

2. **Server API:**
   - https://eatzone.onrender.com/health (should return server status)
   - https://eatzone.onrender.com/api/food/list (should return food items)
   - https://eatzone.onrender.com/api/category/list-all (should return categories)

## Common Issues and Solutions üîß

### Issue: "Page Not Found" on Netlify
**Solution**: The `netlify.toml` file is already configured with proper redirects.

### Issue: "CORS Error"
**Solution**: Server CORS is configured to allow requests from `https://eatzone1.netlify.app`

### Issue: "Authentication Not Working"
**Solution**: 
1. Ensure Google OAuth credentials are properly set
2. Check that redirect URLs match your deployment URLs
3. Verify token storage and retrieval in StoreContext

### Issue: "API Calls Failing"
**Solution**:
1. Check that `VITE_API_BASE_URL` points to `https://eatzone.onrender.com`
2. Verify server is running and accessible
3. Check browser console for specific error messages

## Next Steps üìã

1. **Deploy the fixed client to Netlify**
2. **Test all functionality on the deployed site**
3. **Update Google OAuth redirect URLs if needed**
4. **Monitor server logs for any issues**
5. **Test user authentication flow end-to-end**

## Files Modified üìù

- `client/src/App.jsx` - Added all missing routes
- `client/src/context/StoreContext.jsx` - Added authentication functions
- `client/.env` - Fixed environment configuration
- `client/netlify.toml` - Already properly configured

The application should now deploy successfully and all user pages should be accessible!
